# PopFactory (Population Factory)

PopFactory is a tool for generating simulated genetic population data for use in genetic analysis tools.  PopFactory
 creates [VCF files](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/) that are zipped in bgzf format for easy use with samtools
 .  In order to generate large VCF files, PopFactory can scale out to multiple processes and horizontally to
  multiple nodes. 
 
 ## Installing
 
 PopFactory is written in Python 3. You will need python 3 installed and also pip. The python requirements are all in
  the requirements.txt file and can usually be installed by: 
 ```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
